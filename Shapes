A circle can spin and twirl, and it has no end or beginning. It's like a wheel, that keeps on going, and it's perfectly even.
A square has four straight sides, and all of them are the same. It's like a window pane, that's sturdy and strong, and it always stays the same.
A triangle has three straight sides, and each one is different. It's like a roof, that keeps us safe, and makes us feel content.
The rectangle is a special shape, with two long sides and two short. It's like a door, that opens and shuts, and never stops. It's a solid shape, that's wide and great, and it stands up tall.
Can you name all the shapes, that can be found all around? There's the circle, the square, the triangle, and the rectangle. They're all unique, and they're so neat, they never go out of style.
No matter what shape you find, it's special in its own way. It can be small, or it can be tall, and it's here to stay.
