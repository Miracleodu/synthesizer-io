# WASM Example

## Prequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

(I would recommend LTS but not sure what the minimum version number required to support this project might be)

## Running

> **NOTE** Make sure you turn your audio down before starting because it's quite loud!

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# start a webpack dev server and host the project on http://127.0.0.1:8080
# NOTE: webpack will build the rust code as well
npm serve
```
